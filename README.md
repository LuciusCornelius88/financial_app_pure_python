#Financial console application

**Idea**

This application is a console version of a simple accounting tool. It is developed without any additional modules, only pure python with inbuilt modules is used.

The application implements a classical MVC architecture of web apps, but for console format.

As a frontend the set of 'Interface" modules are used. And as a BD the dump to files is used.

**Implementation**

Just run the main file and follow the instructions.

First you should create Sources and Categories of payments. Then you can create Transactions based on Sources and Categories.
